## A Machine Unlearning Python Framework.

### Overview
Welcome to the Machine Unlearning Python Library, a powerful tool for reversing machine learning models and their effects. This library is designed to help you "untrain" or "unlearn" the knowledge that a machine learning model has acquired, allowing you to protect sensitive data, comply with privacy regulations, or fine-tune your model as needed.

### Features
Model Untraining: Easily untrain machine learning models to forget previously learned information.
Privacy Preservation: Ensure sensitive information is not retained by your model.
Customization: Fine-tune the unlearning process according to your specific requirements.
Compatibility: Works with various popular machine learning frameworks and models.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation and examples to help you get started.
Installation
You can install the Machine Unlearning Python Library using pip:

### bash
Copy code
pip install pybrush
Usage
Here's a quick example of how to use the library:

### python
Copy code
from pybrush import Unlearner

### Load your pre-trained machine-learning model


### Initialize the unlearning tool


### Untrain the model on specific data


### Save the untrained model
